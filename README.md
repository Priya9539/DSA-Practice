💻 Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms practice repository.

This repository contains solutions to coding problems that I solve regularly to improve my problem-solving skills and strengthen my understanding of core computer science concepts.


🚀 About This Repository

- Language Used: Python  
- Focus: Clean code, optimized solutions, and clear logic  
- Goal: Build strong foundations for technical interviews and placements  

Each solution includes:
- Brief problem reference
- Approach explanation
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity

📂 Folder Structure

Problems are organized topic-wise for better clarity:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked List
- Recursion
- Trees
- Graphs

More topics will be added as I continue learning.

📈 Learning Approach

I focus on:
- Understanding patterns instead of memorizing solutions
- Writing readable and structured code
- Improving optimization techniques
- Practicing consistently

🎯 Objective

To continuously improve problem-solving ability and prepare effectively for coding interviews.

Consistency and discipline matter more than speed.  
This repository reflects my ongoing learning journey.
