💻 Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved as part of my continuous learning and interview preparation.

I use this space to improve logical thinking, understand problem-solving patterns, and write optimized Python solutions.

🚀 Repository Highlights

- Language: Python
- Focused on clean and readable code
- Includes time and space complexity analysis
- Organized topic-wise for better structure

📂 Topics Covered

- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Linked List  
- Recursion  
- Trees  
- Graphs  

More topics will be added as I progress.

📌 What You Will Find in Each Solution

Each problem file includes:

- Problem reference
- Brief explanation of the approach
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Well-structured Python implementation

📈 Learning Philosophy

Rather than memorizing solutions, I focus on:

- Understanding patterns
- Improving optimization skills
- Writing structured and maintainable code
- Practicing consistently

🎯 Purpose

To strengthen core computer science fundamentals and prepare effectively for technical interviews and coding assessments.

Continuous improvement is the goal.
